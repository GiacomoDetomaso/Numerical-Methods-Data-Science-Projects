# **Function roots**

This folder contains methods to calculate function's roots, optimizing the operations. 

## Content
1. Roots of a second degree polynomial, reducing the errors that the floating points arithmetic commits with roundings. The focus is on subtractions problems and overflow.
2. Bisection method to calculate the roots of a function. A comparison of the theorical and actual number of iterations is provided as well as an error calculation and function's graph
