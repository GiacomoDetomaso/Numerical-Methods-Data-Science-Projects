# Linear systems utilities

This folder cotains 3 modules, which contains some useful techiques used in linear systems resolution:

- gauss_mod.py: contains all you need to perform a gaussian elimination of a matrix
- linear_system_mod.py: contains a way to solve linear systems with forward and backward substitutions
- lu_mod.py: contains all you need to perform an LU factorization of a matrix, plus function to calculate the inverse of matrix knowing its factorization
